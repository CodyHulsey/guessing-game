README file | Class 3 | Assignment 3

Prepared by: Cody Hulsey

What I did for this assignment:
- Created a new repo titled Class-03
- Created a README.md file
- Validated that my user input was in the correct format, so that I can accept uppercase/lowercase or shorthand answers
- Add a fourth question that takes a numeric input, and indicates to the user whether the guess is 'too high' or 'too low'
- Notified the user at the end of the game how many questions they guessed correctly, so they can celebrate their awesomness
- I also created a while loop question that asks the viewer to guess my number. This will ask for their answer three times before giving up.
- I added console.log to every single counter. This makes it easier to understand the logic behind every counter.
